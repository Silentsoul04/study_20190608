This test suite tests statements from:
ANVL Test Suite IGMP (igmp)
RFC 2236: 'Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2'
(Fenner, November 1997)

ANVL Test Suite Required Setup:
This suite expects to be running against an IGMP v2 host or an
IGMP v2 router. If the DUT is a router, it has to be configured
to accept IGMP packets on 1 interface for some tests and 2 for
some other tests. Some tests require that the router be restarted.
If the DUT is an IGMP v2 host, some tests require that it be
configured to join or leave a specified group.

Many tests expect that the DUT's timers be configured to the
default values specified in the RFC.


This suite should be run on an isolated test net which contains
only the Device Under Test (DUT).
Some tests may flood the network, some may erroneously fail if other
devices are on the network, and some may send packets which can
crash other devices on the network.

The DUT is not configured to act as host, therefore
 the following tests will not be run: 1.1 2.9 2.10 2.11 3.1 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 4.1 4.4 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.5 5.7 5.8 5.9 5.11 6.8 6.2

TEST_DESCRIPTION
If an IGMP v2 router hears a v1 report it must set up a timer
equal to GROUP_MEMBERSHIP_INTERVAL
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 2236, IGMP Version 2, s5 p7
Compatibility with IGMPv1 hosts
TEST_METHOD
-  DUT: Multicast a general query on 2 interfaces
- ANVL: As a host multicast a version 1 report on interface1
- ANVL: As a router send a remotely originated multicast packet
-       on interface2
-  DUT: Forward the packet to ANVL on the interface1
- ANVL: Do not respond to any periodic queries received from
-       the DUT
- ANVL: As a router send a remotely originated multicast packet
-       after GROUP_MEMBERSHIP_INTERVAL on interface2
-  DUT: Do not forward the packet back to ANVL on interface1

To be valid a report must have a valid checksum and any greater than
8 octets long must be accepted for future compatability
TEST_REFERENCE

TEST_METHOD
-  DUT: Multicast a general query
- ANVL: As a host multicast a BAD IGMP v2 report
-  DUT: Discard the report
- ANVL: As a router send a 'remotely-originated' multicast packet
-     : to the DUT on another interface
- CASE: Incorrect checksum
-  DUT: Do not forward the packet back to ANVL(host)
- CASE: Length greater than 8 octets
-  DUT: Forward the packet back to ANVL(host) ignoring extra length
