This test suite tests statements from:
RFC 4443: 'Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6)
for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)
Specification'
(A. Conta (Lucent), S. Deering (Cisco), M. Gupta, December 1998)

ANVL Test Suite Required Setup:
This suite expects to be running against an IPv6 host or a router which
has an ICMPv6 stack implementation.
There are a number of parameters controlling this suite that need to be
setup for a completely automated run.
Many of the tests can be run against a single interface, but more 
thorough testing requires that the machine ANVL is running on be 
connected to 2 interfaces that are connected to the router under test.
The ANVL config file must contain at least one IP interface
configured.



This suite should be run on an isolated test net which contains
only the Device Under Test (DUT).
Some tests may flood the network, some may erroneously fail if other
devices are on the network, and some may send packets which can
crash other devices on the network.

TEST_DESCRIPTION
If the node has more than one unicast address, it must choose
the Source Address of the message as follows:
(b) If the message is a response to a message sent to any other
    address, such as

    - an anycast address implemented by the node

the Source Address of the ICMPv6 packet MUST be a unicast address
belonging to the node

TEST_DESCRIPTION
The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement
sum of the entire ICMPv6 message starting with the ICMPv6 message
type field, prepended with a "pseudo-header" of IPv6 header fields
as specified in [IPv6, section 8.1]. The Next Header value used in
the pseudo-header is 58. For computing the checksum, the checksum
field is set to zero.

TEST_DESCRIPTION
An ICMPv6 error message MUST NOT be originated as a result of
receiving

  (e.2) An ICMPv6 redirect message [IPv6-DISC].
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 4443 Section 2.4. Page 6 'Message Processing Rules' 
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Cause DUT to Assign a global address on <DIface-0>
        for <PREFIX-1>
- ANVL: Cause DUT to add Routing Table entry for global address 
         of <HOST-1> over link-local address of <RTR-1> as First Hop 
- ANVL: Cause DUT to send an ICMPv6 echo request packet to <PREFIX-2> global
        address <HOST-1-IPV6-ADDR> through <DIface-0>.
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <ParamListenTime> seconds) on <AIface-0>.
-  DUT: Send an ICMPv6 echo packet destined to <HOST-1-IPV6-ADDR> through
        <DIface-0>. 
- ANVL: Send an ICMPv6 redirect message containing 
        - IPv6 source address set to <RTR-1-IPV6-ADDR>. 
        - IPv6 destination address set to <DUT-IPV6-ADDR>. 
        - ICMPv6 redirect message body containing 
          - Target address set to <RTR-OTHER-ADDR> (non-existing router). 
          - Destination address set to <HOST-1-IPV6-ADDR>. 
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <ParamListenTime> seconds) on <AIface-0>. 
-  DUT: Do not send any ICMPv6 Error Message because it silently drops 
        the ICMPv6 redirect message set to <RTR-OTHER-ADDR> does not exist.

TEST_DESCRIPTION
An ICMPv6 error message MUST NOT be originated as a result of receiving
a packet sent as a link-layer multicast(there are two exceptions to 
this rule: (2)the Parameter Problem Message, Code 2 - Section 3.4 -
reporting an unrecognized IPv6 option that has the Option Type
highest-order two bits set to 10)
(This test is applicable for Ethernet link-layer only)
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 4443 s2.4(e.4) p6 Message Processing Rules
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Send a ICMPv6 Echo Request message to <DIface-0>, 
        containing:
 	     - Ethernet Destination Address field set to link-layer
        multicast address corresponding to the IPv6 Solicited
        Node multicast address of <DIface-0>
        - IPv6 Source Address field set to address of HOST-1
        - IPv6 Destination Address field set to solicited-node
          multicast address corresponding to the target address
        - IPv6  Destination Option Header, containing:
        - Option Type field set to <UnrecognizedOptionType>,
          which has highest order two bits set to 10
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <ListenTime> seconds) on <AIface-0>
-  DUT: Send an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem error message to <AIface-0>
- ANVL: Verify that received ICMPv6 Parameter Problem message contains:
        - ICMPv6 Code field set to 2 
          (unrecognised IPv6 option encountered)

TEST_DESCRIPTION
An ICMPv6 error message MUST NOT be originated as a result of receiving
a packet sent as a link-layer broadcast (there are two exceptions to
this rule: (1) the Packet Too Big Message - Section 3.2 - to allow
Path MTU discovery to work for IPv6 multicast
(This test is applicable for Ethernet link-layer only)
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 4443 s2.4(e.5) p7 Message Processing Rules
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Cause DUT to Assign a global address on <DIface-0>
        for <PREFIX-1>
- ANVL: Cause DUT to Assign a global address on <DIface-1>
        for <PREFIX-2>
- ANVL: Wait for <DADProcessCompletionTimeout> seconds for DUT to
        complete DAD for the assigned global address on <DIface-0>
- ANVL: Cause DUT to set MTU on <DIface-0> to <HighMTU>
- ANVL: Cause DUT to set MTU on <DIface-1> to <LowMTU>
- ANVL: Send an ICMPv6 Echo Request message to <DIface-0>, 
        containing: 
        - Ethernet Destination Address field set to link-layer
          broadcast address
        - IPv6 Source Address field set to global address of
          HOST-1 over <PREFIX-1>
        - IPv6 Destination Address field set to global address 
          of HOST-2 over <PREFIX-2>
        - IPv6 packet size <DefMTU>
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <ListenTime> seconds) on <AIface-0>

TEST_DESCRIPTION
An ICMPv6 error message MUST NOT be originated as a result of receiving
a packet sent as a link-layer broadcast(there are two exceptions to 
this rule:  (2) the Parameter Problem Message, Code 2 - Section 3.4 
- reporting an unrecognized IPv6 option that has the Option Type 
highest-order two bits set to 10)
(This test is applicable for Ethernet link-layer only)
TEST_REFERENCE

TEST_DESCRIPTION
If the reason for the failure to deliver is that the packet with this 
source address is not allowed due to ingress filtering 
policies, the Code field is set to 5. 
Note: Codes 5 and 6 are more informative subsets of code 1.
So many DUT can send code 1 instead of code 5 and code 6
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 4443 Section 3.1. Page 9 'Destination Unreachable Message' 
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Cause DUT to Assign a global address on <DIface-0>
        for <PREFIX-1>
- ANVL: Cause DUT to Assign a global address on <DIface-1>
        for <PREFIX-2>
- ANVL: Send an IPv6 packet to <DIface-0> containing 
        - IPv6 destination set to <DIface-1-GLOBAL-IPV6-ADDR> 
        - IPv6 source address set to <INVALID_HOST_ADDR> 
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <ParamListenTime> seconds) on <AIface-0> 
-  DUT: Send an ICMPv6 destination unreachable packet through <DIface-0> because 
        it drops the IPv6 packet with source address <INVALID_HOST_ADDR> 
- ANVL: Verify that the ICMPv6 destination unreachable packet 
        contains: 
        - ICMPv6 code field set to 5

TEST_DESCRIPTION
If the reason for the failure to deliver is that the packet with this
source address is not allowed due to egress filtering
policies, the Code field is set to 5.
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 4443 Section 3.1. Page 9 'Destination Unreachable Message'
TEST_METHOD
 - ANVL: Cause DUT to Assign a global address on <DIface-0>
          for <PREFIX-1>
 - ANVL: Cause DUT to Assign a global address on <DIface-1>
          for <PREFIX-3>
- SETUP: Externally configure three IPv6 global addresses <EGRESS-IPV6-0>
        <EGRESS-IPV6-1> and <EGRESS-IPV6-2> for egress filtering on <DIface-1>
-  ANVL: Send ICMPv6 echo packet to <DIface-0> containing:
        - source IPv6 address set to <EGRESS-IPV6-0>
        - destination IPv6 address set to <EGRESS-IPV6-2>
-  ANVL: Listen (for upto <ParamListenTime> seconds) on <AIface-0>
-   DUT: Send an ICMPv6 destination unreachable message to <EGRESS-IPV6-0>
        through <DIface-0> because it drops the IPv6 packet destined to
        <EGRESS-IPV6-2>
- ANVL: Verify that the IPCMv6 destination unreachable message contains:
        - ICMPv6 type field set to 1
        - ICMPv6 code field set to 1 or 5

TEST_DESCRIPTION
Destination Unreachable Message (type 1) includes as much of 
the IPv6 offending (invoking) packet (the packet that caused the
error) as possible without ICMPv6 packet exceeding the minimum IPv6
MTU [IPv6]
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 4443 s3.1 p8 Destination Unreachable Message 
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Send a UDP Packet to <DIface-0> , containing:
     - IPv6 Source Address field set to address of HOST-1
     - IPv6 Destination Address field set to address of <DIface-0>
     - IPv6 Next Header field set to <IPv6-Type-UDP>
     - UDP Destination Port set to <UnusedUDPPort>
     - UDP Data of length 1185 bytes attached. so that the 
       total length of the packet sent is 1233 bytes (including
       IPv6 header and UDP header)
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <ListenTime> seconds) on <AIface-0>
- DUT : Send ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message to <AIface-0>
- ANVL: Verify that the received Destination Unreachable message 
        contains:
    - Code value set to 4
    - and IPv6 Payload length is 1240 bytes instead of 
      1241 bytes (Size of packet sent is 1233bytes + 8bytes in reply message
      including ICMPv6 header) 
      this is to keep the minimum IPv6 MTU size of 1280 bytes in reply

TEST_DESCRIPTION
Packet Too Big Message (type 2) includes as much of the IPv6 
offending (invoking) packet (the packet that caused the
error) as possible without the ICMPv6 packet 
exceeding the minimum IPv6 MTU [IPv6]
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 4443 s3.2 p10 Packet Too Big Message 
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Cause DUT to Assign a global address on <DIface-0>
        for <PREFIX-1>
- ANVL: Cause DUT to Assign a global address on <DIface-1>
        for <PREFIX-2>
- ANVL: Wait for <DADProcessCompletionTimeout> seconds for DUT to
        complete DAD for the assigned global address on <DIface-0>
- ANVL: Cause DUT to set MTU of <DIface-0> to <DefMTU>
- ANVL: Cause DUT to set MTU of <DIface-1> to <LowMTU>
- ANVL: Send an ICMPv6 Echo Request message to <DIface-0>, 
        containing:
        - IPv6 Source Address field set to global address of HOST-1
          over <PREFIX-1>
        - IPv6 Destination Address field set to global address of HOST-2
          over <PREFIX-2>
        - IPv6 packet size greater than <DefMTU> and less than 
          <HighMTU>
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <ListenTime> seconds) on <AIface-0>
-  DUT: Send ICMPv6 Too Big message to <AIface-0>
- ANVL: Verify that received ICMPv6 Too Big message contains: 
        - IPv6 Payload Length field set to (<Minimum-IPv6-MTU> - 
          <IPv6-Header-Len>)

          over <PREFIX-1>
        - IPv6 Destination Address field set to global address of HOST-2
          over <PREFIX-2>
        - IPv6 Hop Limit field set to zero
        - ICMPv6 Data field set to data of <Data-Len> octets

TEST_DESCRIPTION
If an IPv6 node processing a packet finds a problem with a field in
the IPv6 header such that it cannot complete processing the packet, 
it SHOULD originate an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem message to the packet's
source, indicating the type and location of the problem
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 4443 s3.4 p12 Parameter Problem Message
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Send an ICMPv6 Echo Request message to <DIface-0>, 
        containing:
        - IPv6 Source Address field set to address of HOST-1
        - IPv6 Destination Address field set to address of <DIface-0>
        - IPv6 Next Header field set to <InvalidNxtHdr>
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <ListenTime> seconds) on <AIface-0>
-  DUT: Send an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem message to <AIface-0>
- ANVL: Verify that received ICMPv6 Parameter Problem message contains:
        - ICMPv6 Code field set to 1
        - Pointer field pointing to the IPv6 Next Header field
          of the ICMPv6 Echo Request packet previously sent to DUT
TEST_CLASSIFICATION
