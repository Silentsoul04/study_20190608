This test suite tests statements from:
RFC 2453:  'RIP Version 2'
(G. Malkin, Bay Networks, November 1998)

ANVL Test Suite Required Setup:
This suite expects to be running against an IP router that is set up
to accept and advertise RIP routes.   There are a number of parameters
controlling this suite that need to be setup for a completely
automated run.  All tests require at least one interface to be
configured and connected to the machine running ANVL.  Some of the
tests require two interfaces.  Some of the tests require RIP v2 to be
implemented.  Some of the tests require support for setting the
version Compatibility Switch ('RIP Version 2', RFC 2453,
Page 34, Section 5.1.)

This suite should be run on an isolated test net which contains
only the Device Under Test (DUT).
Some tests may flood the network, some may erroneously fail if other
devices are on the network, and some may send packets which can
crash other devices on the network.

>> RIP-8.17
TEST_DESCRIPTION
The "simple split horizon" scheme omits routes learned from one
neighbor in updates sent to that neighbor.
TEST_REFERENCE
Thus implementors may at their option implement simple split horizon
rather than split horizon with poisoned reverse
The router requirements RFC [11] specifies that all implementation of
RIP must use split horizon
TEST_METHOD
RFC 2453 s3.4.3 p15-16 Split horizon
ANVL: Send update for a route with metric n
 DUT: Send update with route missing
 DUT: Send update for route to other network
