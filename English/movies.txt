I have got to pinch a loaf---
this is all gone.

I have no idea to this day

some things are best left unsaid

It is in here---my brain

Hope is a dangerous thing, it can drive people insane

You'd better get used to that idea

a life sentence

you feel you have been rehabiliatated?

without a doubt

it will lead to him

You mean that? you realy mean that??

Time.世间到

5 times 5 is 25

I feel bad, I let him down
armed burglary

I ever heard

what amazes me most is you 

launder that money

It looks that way
knock my wind out

Just put it behind us, move on

give him another month to think about it

that is where I want to live the rest of my life

fix it up new  

you underestimate yourself,  an instituational man

scare me to death

It is down there and I am in here


I guess it comes down to a simple choice

it's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end

what's buried under that tree

you have to pry it up

shine my shoes

lights out, lights on

it comes down to a matter of preference

you hear me?

I want him found

you are thick as thieves,  not a word


He loves geology
will do anything to keep his mind occupied

I am just about finished.
600 years to tunnel through the wall with a rock hammer, in less thant 20

he crawled to freedowm through 500 yards of shit-smelling foulness I can not even imagine

that is the length of five football fields

just half a mile

would u please add this to your outgoing mail?

we hava a warrant for your arrest, open up

when I picture him heading south in his own car

he got it, made it

sometimes it makes me sad,though

I have to remind myself that some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are just too blight.

when they fly away,it is a sin to lock them up

your files say you have served 40 years of a life sentence

well now, let me see

it measn you are ready to rejoin society

to me it is just a made-up word

not because I am in here or because you think I should

I look back on the way I was then

I want to try and talk some sense to him

tell him the way things are

here you go, miss

take a piss, just go

there it is

a promise made to Andy

much obliged   BUXTON 

hope is a good thing

get busy living or get busy dying
