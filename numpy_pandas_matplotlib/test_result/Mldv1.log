This test suite tests statements from:
RFC 2710: 'Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6'
(S. Deering (Cisco Systems), W. Fenner (AT&T Research),
 B. Haberman (IBM), October 1999)

ANVL Test Suite Required Setup:
This suite expects to be running against an IPv6 host or a router
with MLD support
There are a number of parameters controlling this suite.
Those need to be setup for a completely automated run.
Most of the tests can be run against a single interface,
but a few tests also need two interfaces. Thus the machine
acting as ANVL must have two interfaces and should be connected to
two intefaces of the machine acting as DUT for all the tests in
this test suite to be run
The ANVL config file must contain at least one IP interface
configured.



This suite should be run on an isolated test net which contains
only the Device Under Test (DUT).
Some tests may flood the network, some may erroneously fail if other
devices are on the network, and some may send packets which can
crash other devices on the network.

>> IPV6-MLD-1.1
TEST_DESCRIPTION
All MLD messages described ... sent with a link-local IPv6
Source Address, an IPv6 Hop Limit of 1, and an IPv6 Router
Alert option [RTR-ALERT] in a Hop-by-Hop Options header.
(Tests that MLD General Query Message conforms to above
statement)
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 2710 s3 p2 Message Format
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <GeneralQueryRecvWaitTime> seconds) on
        <AIface-0>
-  DUT: Send MLD General Query Message
- ANVL: Verify that received MLD General Query Message contains:
        - IPv6 Source Address field set to link-local IPv6
          Address of <DIface-0>
        - IPv6 Hop Limit field set to 1
        - IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options header containing:
          - Router Alert Option

TEST_DESCRIPTION
In a Query message, the Multicast Address field is set to zero
when sending a General Query
(Tests that MLD General Query Message conforms to abovestatement)
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 2710 s3.6 p4 Multicast Address
RFC 2710 s5 p8 Node State Transition Diagram
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <GeneralQueryRecvWaitTime> seconds) on
         <AIface-0>
-  DUT: Send MLD General Query Message
- ANVL: Verify that received MLD General Query Message contains:
        - MLD Multicast Address field value set to 0

TEST_DESCRIPTION
For each attached link, a router selects one of its link-local
unicast addresses on that link to be used as the IPv6 Source
Address in all MLD packets it transmits on that link.
(Tests that MLD General Query Message conforms to above
statement)TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 2710 s4 p4 Protocol Description
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <GeneralQueryRecvWaitTime> seconds) on
        <AIface-0>
-  DUT: Send MLD General Query Message
- ANVL: Verify that received MLD General Query Message contains:
        - IPv6 Source Address field set to link-local IPv6
           unicast address of <DIface-0>

TEST_DESCRIPTION
To be valid, the Query message MUST come from a link-local IPv6
Source Address, be at least 24 octets long, and have a correct
MLD checksum.
(Tests that MLD General Query Message conforms to above
statement)
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 2710 s5 p8 Node State Transition Diagram
RFC 2710 s6 p11 Router State Transition Diagram
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <GeneralQueryRecvWaitTime> seconds) on
        <AIface-0>
-  DUT: Send MLD General Query Message
- ANVL: Verify that received MLD General Query Message is
        atleast 24 Octet long
- ANVL: Verify that received MLD General Query Message contains:
        - IPv6 Source Address field set to link-local IPv6
          unicast address of <DIface-0>
        - MLD Checksum field value is correct

TEST_DESCRIPTION
MLD messages ARE sent for multicast addresses whose scope is 2
(link-local),including Solicited-Node multicast addresses [ADDR-
ARCH], except for the link-scope, all-nodes address (FF02::1).
(Tests that MLD messages are sent for Solicited-Node multicast
addresses)
TEST_REFERENCE
RFC 2710 s5 p10 Node State Transition Diagram
TEST_METHOD
- ANVL: Send MLD General Query Message to <DIface-0>
        containing:
        - IPv6 Source Address field set to link-local IPv6
          Address of RTR-1
        - IPv6 Destination Address field set to link-scope
          all-nodes multicast address
- ANVL: Listen (for upto <ReportRecvWaitTime> seconds)
        on <AIface-0>
-  DUT: Send MLD Report Message for Solicited Node multicast
        address
